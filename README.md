### Functions of this page that meet the critera:
* When the button is clicked, promts begin for password criteria.
* Prompts include password length between  8 - 128 characters, lower case letters, upper case letters, and/or special characters.
* A password is generated once all choices are made.
* The password is written on the page at the end.
